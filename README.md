# What is PointMark-NN?

PointMark is a tool developed by CSAFE, to take images processed in PointMark
and apply them via neural networks to capture interest points in Shoeprint images.

## What is the purpose of this repo?

The purpose of this repo is to automate what is accomplished via PointMark (finding
interest points in shoeprint images) and do so faster and more accurately, with the
help of neural networks.

This repo contains:

- Neural network models and a heatmapping program for application and viewing results
- Example PDF showing a convolutional operation
